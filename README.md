In this project implemented all features from base and middle levels. Server side was made with Node.js and frontend part with Angular.

I couldn't deploy Node.js Server with Firebase Functions because it's paid.

So on current deployed version that is hosting on Firebase I used mocks data.
Hosting: https://register-events.web.app/events

To run and check server and app, please download this project and run next commands.
